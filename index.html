        <h1>Fighter- Planes</h1>
        <p>Fighter aircraft are fixed-wing military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat. In military
          conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. Domination of the
          airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in tactical and strategic bombing
          of enemy targets.
          The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and
          maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air
          superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its
          doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.
          Many modern fighter aircraft have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as
          fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized
          while still filling the main air superiority role, and these include the interceptor, heavy fighter, and night
          fighter.</p>

          <h1>Pilots-RAF</h1>
          <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm had included personnel from outside the United Kingdom from before the beginning of the Second World War, and many served in the Battle of Britain in summer 1940. Many of these volunteers were British subjects—thus, citizens—coming from territories that made up part of the British Empire. Additionally, a significant part was made up of refugees and exiles from German-occupied Europe and American emigrants.
            The RAF Roll of Honour recognises that 574 pilots, from countries other than the United Kingdom, as flying at least one authorized, operational sortie with an eligible unit during the period between 10 July to 31 October 1940, alongside 2,353 British pilots. The numbers differ slightly from the participants whose names are engraved on the Battle of Britain Monument in London, unveiled on 18 September 2005.
            All pilots, regardless of nationality, who flew with British units during the Battle are known collectively, after a phrase coined by Winston Churchill, as "The Few".</p>
